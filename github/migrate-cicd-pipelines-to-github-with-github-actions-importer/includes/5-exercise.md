Next you will have the opportunity to walk through a migration with the help of Valet. 

> Valet is currently private and you must be onboard prior to using it. Please reach out to [GitHub Sales](https://github.com/enterprise/contact) to inquire about being granted access. 

To get started:
1. Use the ```valet-customers/labs``` repository as a template to generate a new GitHub repository.
2. Select which learning path to begin with. There are currently learning paths for:
   - [Migrations from Azure DevOps to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/blob/main/azure_devops/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from CircleCI to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/blob/main/circle_ci/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from GitLab CI to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/blob/main/gitlab/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from Jenkins to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/blob/main/jenkins/readme.md)
   - [Migrations from Travis CI to GitHub Actions](https://github.com/valet-customers/labs/blob/main/travis/readme.md)
3. Each learning path describes how to configure your codespace, bootstrap a CI/CD environment, and troubleshoot the Valet CLI.
